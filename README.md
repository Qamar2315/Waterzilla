# WaterZilla - Online Water Delivery Management System

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

WaterZilla is a robust full-stack web application designed to streamline the online water purchasing and delivery process. Built with a powerful MERN-like stack, it features a modern React frontend and offers the flexibility of two distinct backend implementations: one using **Node.js with Express, Sequelize, and MySQL**, and another using **Node.js with Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB**.

This application provides a seamless, intuitive portal for customers to order water and track deliveries, while equipping administrators with a comprehensive dashboard to manage every aspect of the businessâ€”from customers and orders to inventory and sales reporting.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or newer)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   **For MySQL Backend:** A running MySQL server instance.
-   **For MongoDB Backend:** A running MongoDB server instance.

### Installation & Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Qamar2315/Waterzilla.git
cd Waterzilla
```

#### 2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the client directory and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Note:** The frontend is configured to communicate with the backend at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### 3. Backend Setup (Choose one)

You can run either the MySQL or the MongoDB backend.

##### Option A: MySQL Backend

1.  **Navigate and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Database Configuration:**
    -   Open the `server/config/config.json` file.
    -   Update the `development` object with your MySQL username, password, and desired database name.
    ```json
     "development": {
        "username": "your_mysql_user",
        "password": "your_mysql_password",
        "database": "waterzilla_db",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "dialect": "mysql"
      }
    ```
3.  **Create Database & Run Migrations:**
    -   From the `/server` directory, run the Sequelize CLI commands to set up your database schema.
    ```bash
    # Make sure you have sequelize-cli installed globally or as a dev dependency
    # npm install -g sequelize-cli
    npx sequelize-cli db:create
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    ```

##### Option B: MongoDB Backend

1.  **Navigate and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server2
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Database Configuration:**
    -   Open the `server2/index.js` file.
    -   Ensure the MongoDB connection string points to your local database instance. The default is `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/waterzilla`.
    ```javascript
    async function main() {
      await mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/waterzilla');
      console.log("connected");
    }
    ```
3.  **Seed Initial Data (Optional):**
    -   The `/server2` directory contains a `seeder.js` file to populate the database with initial admin data. To run it:
    ```bash
    node seeder.js
    ```

## Running the Application

To run WaterZilla, you need to start both the client and your chosen backend server.

1.  **Start the Backend Server** (from `/server` or `/server2` directory):
    ```bash
    npm start
    # Or for development with nodemon
    # nodemon index.js
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

2.  **Start the Frontend React App** (from the `/client` directory in a new terminal):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will open automatically in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
